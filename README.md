# DataVisualization_Python_MongoDB
Data visualization example using Python and MongoDB

# Purpose
This code was developed as part of a CS-340 class focused on client/server development using Python and MongoDB.  The ficticious client for this software trains rescue dogs and needs a dashboard to visualize a database shared with them from local animal shelters.  The animal_shelter.py file is responsible for connecting to the database and handling basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.  The main.py file creates the interactive dashboard and passes queries to the database through an instance of the animalShelter class.
